#  Cross Domain Text Summarization Dataset

## 1. Introduction

Currently, the majority of advanced pre-trained language models excel in downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks when fine-tuned on specific datasets. However, these models exhibit proficiency only within their designated domains. Even performing on the same task such as text summarization, the performance are affected by slight variations in the domain. Consequently, we propose a novel cross-domain text summarization dataset that encompasses various domains, including news with headlines, dialogue with summaries, scientific papers with abstracts, and legislature bills with summaries. In Section 3, we will elaborate on the selection of datasets and the sampling strategies employed.

    abstract = "Neural sequence-to-sequence models have provided a viable new approach for abstractive text summarization (meaning they are not restricted to simply selecting and rearranging passages from the original text). However, these models have two shortcomings: they are liable to reproduce factual details inaccurately, and they tend to repeat themselves. In this work we propose a novel architecture that augments the standard sequence-to-sequence attentional model in two orthogonal ways. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator network that can copy words from the source text via pointing, which aids accurate reproduction of information, while retaining the ability to produce novel words through the generator. Second, we use coverage to keep track of what has been summarized, which discourages repetition. We apply our model to the CNN / Daily Mail summarization task, outperforming the current abstractive state-of-the-art by at least 2 ROUGE points.",
